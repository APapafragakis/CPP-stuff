# Car Repair Cost Calculator

## Overview

This C++ console application calculates the repair costs for a new and a used car based on the number of tires needing repair, the paint percentage, and the number of missing lights. The user is prompted to input the costs of tires, paint, and lights, and the program provides the total repair cost for each car.

## How to Use

1. **Compile the Program:**
   - Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed on your Windows system.
   - Compile the program using the provided source code file (`main.cpp`) and the necessary header file (`std_lib_facilities.h`).

     ```powershell
     g++ main.cpp -o car_repair_calculator.exe
     ```

2. **Run the Program:**
   - Execute the compiled program.

     ```powershell
     .\car_repair_calculator.exe
     ```

3. **Input:**
   - Enter the cost of each tire, paint, and light when prompted.

4. **Output:**
   - The program will display the status of both a new and a used car, including the number of tires needing repair, paint percentage, and missing lights.
   - It will also show the total repair cost for each car.

## Input Constraints

- Ensure the costs and attributes provided are valid.
- The program will check for valid attributes and costs, and it will display an error message if any input is invalid.
